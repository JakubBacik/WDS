# WDS
## Main info
The goal of the project was to create a graphical application that visualizes data from sensors simulating a car's front parking sensors. The project consists of both hardware and software components. The first part consists of an Arduino Uno microcontroller and 4 ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04). The second part, on the other hand, is an application designed to visualize whether there is an obstacle in front of the sensors and, if so, at what distance.
